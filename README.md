## [M.D.V.A.] : Medical Doctorines Veterans' Affairs

* (Q): What can the VA do to supply immediate medical-aid and public-housing to our current homeless Vets? 
* (A): The VA needs to rethink their current situation for the help they can offer to the homeless vet communities in all states, especially within the state of California. The VA has suffered a few down-falls defined by corruption surfacing within their system of leading officials. Regardless of the basis of corruption found within the former VA Seceretary's leadership, this should not become a benign form of punishment to our vets and their families who are in desperate need of crisis-aid reliefe opportunities from our VA and from our federal government. These will relay in any un-established benefits that are floating within our treasury-system, awaiting to be sorted out legally by Congress in order to be returned to the hands of our Veterans' in need and their families.

## [H.A.U.D.] : Veteran-Citizens' Community Restoration Act

# Non-Profit Fundraising : VA-Support Foundation

### Non-Profit VA Sector : (Bipartisan Party-Rider)

* (Q): How can a non-profit benefit a VA's cause?
* (A): As a non-profit, federal government, private sector advocate-advisor for the Veterans' Community, I aim the protect and preserve our Veterans' rights and to uphold their values and worth and stature within the community here on Homeland and even while out over seas on deployment.

## Veterans in Poverty who are Homeless : [rates at 11%]
* (Q): What is [HUD] doing about this ongoing neglect and crisis of the suffering Vets?
* (A): I have recently contacted the Housing Authority in regards to the current systematic-errors they have been neglecting to over-see immediately, as far as Public Housing goes, there is serious issues with [HUD] enforcing its civil-duties by keeping their Public Housing Profiles up to date with Census, which has caused an overall system-clog; as well as loss of money which is due to be paid back directly to the Veterans' community. The benefits the Vets have been recieving, or not being able to recieve, in this case is due to Public Housing Authority allowing non-low income families to bunk in Public Housing Units for years at the cost of low-income living. This has played havoc for our vet community in many different ways. Basically, the current suffering and homelessness in our veteran-community, has been completely unnecessary and has been at the cost of hundreds of Veteran lives at the hands of careless Housing-Directors. Lack of understanding for the actual existence of a Veteran-Homeless Community is not easy to understand, or even to fully comprehend to its fullest extent.

* (Q): Will this ever be corrected by the proper officials?
* (A): I can see a higher increase in improvement of this ongoing crisis, but it is not a 100% success, or even a 95% success, which is unacceptable to me personally; considering I represent the Veterans' through this darkened time in their lives as an Advocate and an Advisor. [ACP_Advisor.net] It has been a long journey accross a marred, and scar-stricken Homeland History, but the fight is far from over to restore good-fortune to every Veteran in the U.S. who has been mamed by homelessness and who have struggled and suffered, yet who have survived the worst and who have stood tall in the darkness of the streets; braving the bitter-cold nights alone and hungry. This is not the American Dream my father told me about, infact, this sounds like a nightmare that needs to be 100% conquered/tackled and stomped out by (Fiscal Year) 2017 or we could lose more heroes to the streets.

# Mental Health-Care for Homeless Vets

## (Dr. Karen Seal Reports): [L.R.A.P.M.P.] University of California, San Fransisco ---
* "After the start of the Iraq War, there is a growing burden of Mental-Illness, particularly; Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)," said Dr. Seal. "They will require increased allocation of resources for better detection and early intervention to prevent cases of permanent strands of further, more indepth and severe; Chronic Mental-Illness, which threatens individual vets, their families, and communities."

### Afghanistan War on Terror : [2001]
[1.6 Million]: more than 1.6 million U.S. soldiers have served, many of whom have been exposed to atleast one or both of the following triggers that are the underlining cause of returning vets' mental illnesses:

# Iraq War --- (March of 2003) [Compiling Further Research]

After 4 years, diagnoses among those same veterans had risen to nearly [28 percent].
